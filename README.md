# Solidity Practice

## Motivation

Allows me to expand my knowledge in programming and start working on the blockchain while
also providing me a reference catalogue should I get stuck trying to explain how to accomplish
certain things within the context of Solidity.

## Prerequisites

- Must have an Ethereum Runtime

### Clone

```
git clone https://github.com/OkelleyDevelopment/Solidity-Practice
cd Solidity-Practice
```

### Installing

```
npm install -g truffle
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

### Testing

```
ganache-cli &
truffle compile [--all][--network <name>]
truffle migrate [--reset][-f <number>] [--network <name>] [--compile-all] [--verbose-rpc]
truffle test
```

## Future Goals

- [] Pair some of these things with a web front end
- [] Build a simple Ethereum chain analyzer
- [] Move up a layer and begin reading off Polygon
- [] Build out more advanced contracts
